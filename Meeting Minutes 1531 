Meeting Minutes 1531 
4/3 Fri 2:30 (After tut lab)
	Mistake with name return specifications ie channel_id and u_id? 
	
28/2 Mon 7:30
	Work on different functions in the same file to avoid merge conflict
    Emil (all 3 functions, list, listall and create) and Chris ( I try work on tests) on Channels 
	Alex (channel_messages) and Alexander (channel_details) on Channel
	Remember to add messagers object into channel create, later avoid conflict now 
    Issue changing and merging changes to other.py (add object to clearv1 function) without committing changes on   separate branch 
    Each person make their branch on the function they’re working on, afterwards merge branches before merging to master. Resolve merge conflicts between branches instead of with master. Hence, master merge should be perfect.
	More issues related to merging than code logic

26/2 Sat 7:30
    Merged auth_reg branch (by Alex) with master
    Emil will work on channels_list
    Alexander and I will work on tests for channels
    Discussed: people implementing functions don’t work on the tests?
